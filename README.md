# The Science of Netflix

A code along workshop for the Flatiron School Meetup [The Science Behind Netflix Recommendations : Talk | London](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-the-science-behind-netflix-recommendations-talk-london-tickets-96698721479).
The [original materials for this workshop](https://github.com/yishuen/meetup-movie-recommender) were developed by Flatiron NYC Coach [Yish Lim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yishuen-lim/) and were adapted for online Zoom broadcast by [David John Baker](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1/science-of-netflix).

This version of the workshop is being presented on:

* March, 24th 2020 and can be accessed [here via Zoom](https://wework.zoom.com/j/227461308) 

You can access the [slides from here]().

You can access our [collaborative document here]().

The dataset used is **The Movies Dataset** found on Kaggle, specifically from the file `ratings small.csv`: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

If you want to read more about the math behind SVD, check out Chapter 9. We highly *recommend* it if you want to understand how SVD works using gradient descent + alternating least squares.
